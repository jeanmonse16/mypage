# Requirements

* You are provided with an incomplete <Checkout /> component.
* You are not allowed to add any additional HTML elements.
* You are not allowed to use refs.

* Demo video - You can view how the completed functionality should look at: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o2Rz5HBOPOEp9DlvE9FWnLJoW9KUp5-C/view?usp=sharing

* Once the <Checkout /> component is mounted, load the products using the getProducts function.
* Once all the data is successfully loaded, hide the loading icon.
* Render each product object as a <Product/> component, passing in the necessary props.
* Implement the following functionality:
  * The add and remove buttons should adjust the ordered quantity of each product
  * The add and remove buttons should be enabled/disabled to ensure that the ordered quantity can’t be negative and can’t exceed the available count for that product.
  * The total shown for each product should be calculated based on the ordered quantity and the price
  * The total in the order summary should be calculated
  * For orders over $1000, apply a 10% discount to the order. Display the discount text only if a discount has been applied.
  * The total should reflect any discount that has been applied
  * All dollar amounts should be displayed to 2 decimal places

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
